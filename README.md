# The Shoppies App

## Project Description

[The Shoppies](https://shoppies-client-app.netlify.app/) is a web application that searches for movies from OMDb that can be nominated for The Shoppies, movie awards for entrepreneurs. Nominated movies can be saved and deleted from my [Shoppies API database](https://shoppies-api-app.herokuapp.com/movies).

(Note: In reality, The Shoppies Awards, hosted by [TSC](https://www.tsc.ca/) nominates brands from their affiliated ecommerce store. For the purpose of this internship application project, I am using movies.)
